This repository contains the main server file `server.js`, built on the Express framework and designed to serve as the backbone for our application's backend. The server is configured to handle JSON requests through appropriate middleware, enabling seamless data exchange in the common JSON format. It also implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to ensure that our API can be safely accessed from various domains, thereby enhancing the app's usability across different web applications.

To maintain a structured and efficient data management system, the server connects to a MongoDB database utilizing the Mongoose ODM. This setup allows for robust interactions with the database through an object modeling approach, facilitating easy data validation, query building, and business logic integration.

Additionally, the project prioritizes reliability and maintainability through comprehensive error handling mechanisms and logging functionality. By leveraging a library similar to morgan, the server efficiently logs HTTP requests and errors, providing clear insights into server operations and facilitating quick debugging and issue resolution.

This setup aims to provide a solid foundation for developing scalable, secure, and efficient web applications, ensuring an optimal infrastructure for handling API requests, database interactions, and application logic.
